## Project Overview

In today's digital era, users access platforms from a myriad of devices with various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. Ensuring a consistent and optimized user experience across these devices is vital. For a platform like BAG, where users might be accessing simulations and training modules on-the-go or from different settings, it's essential that our content looks impeccable and remains functional irrespective of the device being used.
