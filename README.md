## Project Overview

In today's digital era, users access platforms from a myriad of devices with various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. Ensuring a consistent and optimized user experience across these devices is vital. For a platform like BAG, where users might be accessing simulations and training modules on-the-go or from different settings, it's essential that our content looks impeccable and remains functional irrespective of the device being used.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure for this project includes a basic template that you can modify and expand to fit your specific content. Here's a simplified example:

     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
         <title>BAG Ltd - Responsive Website</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <header>
             <!-- Add your header content here -->
         </header>
     
         <main>
             <!-- Add your main content here -->
         </main>
     
         <footer>
             <!-- Add your footer content here -->
         </footer>
     </body>
     </html>
CSS Styles

To style this project, you can use the included CSS file (style.css). Here's an example of styling the footer:
     ```html
     
          /* Footer styles */
          footer {
              background-color: #333;
              color: #fff;
              padding: 20px;
              text-align: center;
          }

Sticky Footer

To create a sticky footer that stays at the bottom of the page, the project utilizes CSS with a flex layout. The following CSS code ensures that the footer remains at the bottom of the page, even if the content is minimal:
     ```css
     
               /* Apply a flex layout to the body for a sticky footer */
     body {
         display: flex;
         flex-direction: column;
         min-height: 100vh;
     }
     
     /* Style for the main content area (adjust as needed) */
     main {
         flex: 1;
     }
     
     /* Footer styles */
     footer {
         background-color: #333;
         color: #fff;
         padding: 20px;
         text-align: center;
     }
